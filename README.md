# Auto Suggest

Welcome to the Auto Suggest project repository! This project focuses on implementing auto-suggest functionality using C++.

## Introduction

Auto Suggest is a feature that provides users with suggestions or completions based on the input they provide. It's commonly used in search engines, text editors, and various other applications to enhance user experience and productivity.

This project aims to demonstrate the core concepts behind auto-suggest functionality and provide a basic implementation using C++. Users can input partial words or phrases, and the program will generate suggestions based on a predefined dataset or algorithm.
